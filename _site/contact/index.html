<p>Hi, I'm Alex, a designer by day and baker by every other spare minute. I live in beautiful Brighton, home to some <a href="http://localhost:8000/bakerofbrighton/brighton-baking-guide/">great chocolate makers and patisseries</a>.</p>

<p>My fondness for baking escalated about 2 years ago, when I realised what a fantastic creative outlet it could be. Losing myself in something tangible and non-computery was a wonderful release and I've since made everything from breads to delicate genoise to cupcakes and macaroons. Not to mention that I've found kneading dough is great for RSI :-)</p>
