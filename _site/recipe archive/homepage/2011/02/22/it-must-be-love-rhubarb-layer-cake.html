<p>Somehow Valentine's Day came and went without a blog post, perhaps giving the impression that the day of love passed by with the oven off. But needless to say there <em>was</em> a cake and it was as fine a cake as I'd ever made. Following on from my obsession with <a href="http://localhost:8000/bakerofbrighton/pandan-madeleines/">green</a> or <a href="http://localhost:8000/bakerofbrighton/pistachio-chocolate-macarons/">boozy</a> things I've now moved on to mousse-based treats and have been trying to attain thatÂ elusive perfection of the perfect slice ever since.</p>

<p>V-day was as close as I've come yet to this ideal with a rhubarb mousse cake made for my dearest <a href="http://www.sheepfilms.co.uk" target="_blank">D</a>. Alas, working in a frenzy the day before Valentine's day I didn't take note of my ingredients and thus have no recipe to give as such. But the quantities are roughly based on <a href="http://www.rosylipsandlavender.com/2009/07/chocolate-triple-layer-mousse-cake-aka.html" target="_blank">this beautiful cake</a> - I hope this suffices.</p>

<p>Now, as for further excuses on why I haven't blogged closer to Valentine's: it's been an odd couple of weeks, not untouched by sadness and loss. Perhaps I should remember that that's why cakes exists: to sweeten life's little (and great) sorrows.</p>
