These guys have really let themselves go, wouldn't you say? While most macarons are sveltly stuffed with a dollop of filling, these are teetering precariously with a greedy helping of cranberry cream. I couldn't be more pleased with them!</p>

<p>After faffing about with a few versions of stabilised fruit cream I settled on this cranberry edition, using some frozen cranberries that have been languishing about the freezer since Christmas. The cranberry cream rounds are easy enough to cut out - just use a small, plain cookie cutter and voila.</p>

<p>Note: this is a make-ahead recipe, as the cream needs to set for at least 2-3 hours, but preferably overnight.</p>

<p>RECIPE:</p>

<p>Stabilised fruit cream:</p>

<ul>
<li>250ml double cream</li>
<li>1 to 1 1/2 cups of tart fruit (I used frozen cranberries)</li>
<li>2/3 cups sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons gelatine</li>
</ul>

<p>Macarons:</p>

<ul>
<li>90g egg whites, aged for at least 48 hours</li>
<li>30g caster sugar</li>
<li>200g icing sugar</li>
<li>100g finely ground almonds</li>
<li>A few drops red food colouring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the stabilised fruit cream:</strong> Place the fruit and sugar in a small pan and bring to a simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the fruit is soft. At this point you can strain the mixture through a sieve or smush into a puree, depending on how smooth you want your cream. In either case, set aside to cool.</p>

<p>Place the gelatine in a medium bowl and add 3 tablespoons of water. Leave for 5 minutes until the gelatine is spongy, then put in the microwave for 10-15 seconds until dissolved. Stir in the fruit mixture.</p>

<p>In a seperate, chilled bowl whip the cream to soft peaks. Fold into the cooled fruit puree then transfer to a square dish (I used a 9 by 9 inch dish) and pop into the fridge to set.</p>

<p><strong>For the macarons: </strong>Line 3-4 baking sheets with parchment or silicon mats. Preheat the oven to 160° C  (140 if using a fan oven). Blitz the icing sugar and powdered almonds in a food processor until very fine. Beat the egg whites on high, adding the caster sugar in small batches, until stiff, glossy peaks form. Add a few drops of food colouring and beat quickly again, until the colour is incorporated. Tip: I tend to put a few tablespoons of the beaten egg whites into a small bowl, add and mix in the food colouring then transfer the resulting "roux" back into the rest of the meringue.</p>

<p>Gently but quickly mix the ground nuts and sugar into the meringue until the dough is glossy and flowing like lava. Transfer into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle and pipe even cookies onto the baking sheets. Leave the cookies to set for 15-20 minutes before baking to allow them to form a "skin" on top.</p>

<p>Bake for about 12 minutes then remove and leave to cool completely. If the macarons stick to the matt, pour a bit of hot water underneath the baking parchment and swirl around gently to steam the cookies off.</p>

<p>When ready to assemble, select a plain cookie cutter that roughly matches the size of your macarons and cut out rounds of cream, wiggling them atop a macaron and sandwiching. Stretch your jaw wide and devour.</p>
