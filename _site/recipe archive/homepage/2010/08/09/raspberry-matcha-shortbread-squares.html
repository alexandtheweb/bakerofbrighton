<p>Once you've grasped the idea behind a classic recipe, the temptation to play around with it begins to creep in. This was the case of classic lemon bars, which I'd made so many times that I couldn't help but think: surely it's time to get experimental. The inspiration came from <a href="http://www.thedailyspud.com/2010/07/14/lemon-bars-shortbread-redcurrants/#comment-35897">this blog</a>, which, instead of a lemony custard topping, used lovely, tart red currants. I wanted even more vivid colours in my variation: so a matcha-tinged shortbread base and an almost magenta pink raspberry custard. Crumbs, they were good.</p>

<p>RECIPE:</p>

<p><strong>Shortbread base:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> 1 3/4 cups plain flour</li>
<li> 2/3 cups icing sugar</li>
<li> 1/4 cup corn starch</li>
<li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li> 1 Tbsp matcha powder</li>
<li> 170g unsalted buter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Raspberry topping:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li> 1 1/2 Tbsp freshly grated lemon zest</li>
<li> 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
<li> 1/2 cup freshly squeezed raspberry juice</li>
<li> 1 Tbsp lemon zest</li>
<li> 1/4 cup milk</li>
<li> 1 1/3 cup caster sugar</li>
<li> 4 large eggs</li>
<li> 3 Tbsp flour</li>
</ul>

<p>1. <strong>For the shortbread base:</strong> combine all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse for about 30 seconds until you get a sandy consistency. Pour into a 9" x 13" pan lined with parchment paper, distribute evenly then press down gently with floured fingertips or with the bottom of a ramekin. Refridgerate for about 30 minutes then bake at <strong>170 degrees</strong> for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>2. <strong>For the topping:</strong> press the raspberries through a fine sieve or cheesecloth - you're looking to get about 1/2 of a cup of fresh, seed-free juice. In a medium bowl, stir the sugar with the flour, then whisk in the eggs. Add the lemon zest, juices, milk and whisk to blend.</p>

<p>3. Reduce oven temperature to<strong> 160 degrees</strong>. Pour the filling onto the warm crust and bake for about 20 minutes until the custard is almost set. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting with a knife, wiping - or licking - it clean between each cut.</p>
