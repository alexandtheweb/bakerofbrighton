<p>When the cold and dark days of English autumn creep in, all my baking efforts seem to turn naturally to fragrant spices: cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves. Practically and traditionally, the dominance of spices during winter months is due to their preserving and anti-bacterial qualities - in the absence of fresh food, they keep produce and meat and help battle colds and coughs. But to me they become, more romantically, a form of escapism. Warming and perfumed, they're talismans that transports us, when the sun is setting at 3 in the afternoon, to sunnier months and more exotic climes. Moroccan markets, Turkish bazaars.</p>

<p>It follows that their natural partner in baking should be that other preserving, healing substance that owes everything to summer. Buckwheat honey, which I've been fed since childhood whenever I had a sore throat, is no ordinary, tame honey. I've seen it described, aptly, as the "tall,Â  dark stranger of honeys". It is indeed dark, sharp, deeply fragrant.</p>

<p>No recipe with this post, as I didn't take down quantities when I made the honey cream filling for these tarts. Simply whip a cup of double cream, slowly drizzling in as much buckwheat honey as strikes your fancy - I think I used about 3 tablespoons - and add just a bit of cardamom and nutmeg. Apologies for the awful photo - light is at a premium in the UK this time of year!</p>
