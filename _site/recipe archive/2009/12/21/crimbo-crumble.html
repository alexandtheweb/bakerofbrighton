<p>Having parents who live in Texas means I'm never short of one of the most famous Texas crops: pecans. They arrive every few months, in giant half-kilo bags no less, and quickly make their way into my baked goods. Pecan pies, spiced sugar pecans, pecan-encrusted chicken - you name it. And now they just happened to fall into these lovely Christmasy treats, made for some friends' festive do. Although officially known as apple cranberry bars, I think I'll rename these "crimbo crumble bars". Incidentally, I can see these working really well with warm custard poured over them :-)</p>

<p>RECIPE:</p>

<p><strong>For the apple-cranberry-pecan mixture:<br />
</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3 medium-sized apples, peeled, cored and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
<li> 1/4 cup plain flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup chopped pecans</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons cinammon</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried sweetened cranberries (craisins)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the crust and crumble mixture:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 cups flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>220 grams butter, plus a bit extra for greasing</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cinammon</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>1. Preheat the oven to 170 degrees and grease a 20cm x 20cm square baking dish.</p>

<p>2. <strong>For the apple-cranberry-pecan mixture:</strong> place all the ingredients in a medium bowl and toss gently to combine. Set aside.</p>

<p>3. <strong>For the crust and crumble mixture:</strong> mix the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Using an electric mixer or a food processor pulse the flour mixture and butter together until medium-sized crumbs form (you don't want giant hunks of butter, but you don't want sand either!). Add in the egg and pulse again, just until combined.</p>

<p>4. Remove one heaping cupful of the flour mixture and place in a medium bowl with the cinammon and pecans to make the crumble topping. Press the rest of the flour mixture gently into the bottom of the greased baking dish using a spoon or the bottom of a ramekin. Top with the apples, then the rest of the crumble.</p>

<p>5. Bake for 40-50 minutes until the top of the crumble is golden brown. Remove, cool for about an hour, then cut into bars.</p>
