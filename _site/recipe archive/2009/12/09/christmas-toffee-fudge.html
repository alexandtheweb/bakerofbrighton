	<h1>Festive toff-fudge</h1>
	<p class="meta">09 Dec 2009</p>
	<p>So it seems I have no patience for toffee. Standing there, watching the sugar and cream mixture slowly darken as it bubbled and foamed furiously over high heat, I got fidgety and couldn't wait for it to climb to the required toffee-making temperature. Not really a problem, as I happily ended up with lovely fudge instead. This festive, fragrant, incredibly sugary confection went down a treat!</p>

<p>RECIPE:</p>

<ul>
<li>300g sugar</li>
<li>300ml double (heavy) cream</li>
<li>25g butter</li>
<li>Big pinch of salt</li>
<li>50g dried cranberries</li>
<li>50 g pistachios</li>
</ul>

<p>1 - Put the cream and sugar in a heavy saucepan and heat over low-medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.</p>

<p>2 - Increase the heat and place a candy / jam thermometer in the pan. Let the mixture boil until the thermometer reaches 236 degrees F (soft ball stage) - it will get quite violent!</p>

<p>3 - Once the temperature is reached, begin stirring the mixture - slowly at first, then more vigorously - until it becomes smooth and glossy. Quickly stir in the pistachios and cranberries and pour the mixture into a loaf pan lined with well-greased parchment paper</p>

<p>4 - Allow the fudge to cool for 5 minutes before scoring it with a knife into bite-sized pieces. Allow to cool completely before inverting from the pan and finishing the cutting.</p>
