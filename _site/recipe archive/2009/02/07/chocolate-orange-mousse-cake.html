<p>It was <a href="http://fordie.co.uk/">Mark's</a> last day at Madgex on Friday and since no proper sendoff seems complete without a cake, I baked.</p>

<p>The recipe for the chocolate orange mousse cake came from a rather unlikely source: a big unwieldy<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mary-Berrys-Complete-Cookbook-Berry/dp/0751364401">Mary Berry cookbook</a> I won a couple years ago at a Brighton Geek Christmas dinner. The hefty book has proven unexpectedly full of good tips and recipes.  The cake itself is one of those seemingly sophisticated but actually effortless numbers: a quick, delicate sponge, sliced in two and sandwiched with a rich mousse. Throw a bit of ganache on top and voila!</p>

<p>I couldn't find an online version of the recipe but <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/541871-recipes-chocolate-orange-mousse-cake">this one</a> approximates it pretty well.  It went down a treat and is definitely a keeper.</p>
