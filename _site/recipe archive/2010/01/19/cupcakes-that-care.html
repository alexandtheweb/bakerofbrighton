<p>Whenever a horrible human tragedy strikes somewhere distant and the images of loss and devastation start to saturate our minds, we tend to succumb to a feeling of helplessness, of being too far away or too insignificant to make a difference. But what always amazes me is how LITTLE it takes to get over that feeling - and to make a real difference.</p>

<p>At my Brighton office today we had a cupcake sale, which raised a box full of cash for victims of the Haiti earthquake. Each little treat brought in 2 pounds. And it wasn't just the sugar buzz we were feeling - it was the great thrill of knowing that <strong>there is always something you can do</strong>.</p>
