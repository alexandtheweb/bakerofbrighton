	<p>I can't count the times I've run out of self-raising flour! But a home edition works just as well as the store-bought stuff, you can only make as much as you need, and you don't have to worry about the flour being off (unless your baking powder is - always check the expiration date!). Self-raising flour does have a shelf life of about 6 months.</p>

<p>Recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup plain flower</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Increase the ratios as needed.</p>
