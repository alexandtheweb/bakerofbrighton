<p>These cardamom cranberry cookies, or the fabulous CCCs, are a twist on the classic oatmeal raisin cookie. With just two little changes to the traditional ingredients we get something new and exotic! Well, ok, it's just a little twist, but enough to make these cookie jar staples a bit more exciting.  They're also soft, chewy and keep very well - although less so in a glass cookie jar, from which they mysteriously vanish.</p>
<p>RECIPE: </p>
<ul>
<li>115g butter</li>
<li>2/3 cups light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3/4 cups plain flour</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups oats</li>
<li>3/4 cups dried cranberries ("Craisins")</li>
</ul>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>1. Beat the sugar and egg until light and fluffy - but not too much. Add the egg and vanilla, mixing thoroughly.<br />
2. Whisk the dry ingredients in a medium bowl then gently mix into the sugar-egg-butter mixture. Stir in the oats and the cranberries.<br />
3. Roll into smallish balls, about 1-11/2 inches in diameter. Pop in the fridge for 20-3o minutes.<br />
4. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Place the cookies on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, rotating half-way through the baking time.</p>
<p>Makes about 18  yummy cookies.</p>
