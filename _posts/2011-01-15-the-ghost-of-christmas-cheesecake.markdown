Most grappling with Christmas leftovers involves turkey. But what about all these bits of sweet morsels that inevitably end up kicking about your fridge and cupboard? I certainly was clueless about what to do with mine, until a friend brought over a jar of mulled wine conserves and the plot came together and unfolded as such: take leftover gingerbread and brandy butter. Blitz the gingerbread in a food processor and combine with melted brandy butter to make a base for a cheesecake. Make the cheesecake filling with leftover eggs, cream and cream cheese. And finally, for the topping, strain the mulled wine conserve, combine with leftover pomegranate juice and gelatin to make a cheesecake mirror. The result? In principle and proportion, nothing differs in this recipe from the <a href="http://localhost:8000/bakerofbrighton/strawberry-mirror-cheesecake/">strawberry mirror cheesecake</a> I made some months ago. But the flavour combinations helped the indulgence and warmth of Christmas linger for just that little bit longer, through the first dreary days of January.</p>
