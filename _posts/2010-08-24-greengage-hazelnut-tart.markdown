<p>Here's a phrase to sum up this day and age: the Dalai Lama is on Twitter. You can follow him today and have daily nuggets of wisdom injected into your follower stream. His Holiness' very presence on the microblogging platform is a little bit surreal. His pronouncements, at times, a little bit naff. But sometimes he really <a href="http://twitter.com/DalaiLama/status/21989126596">gets it right</a>, with his message being all the more relevant when it appears amidst 140 character pronouncements of angst from your friends or yourself: </p>
<blockquote><p>"One of the most effective ways to overcome anxiety is to try to shift the focus of attention away from self and toward others."</p></blockquote>
<p>It really doesn't take much, either. Bake a cake and offer it around in exchange for raising <a href="https://www.donate.bt.com/dec_form_pfa.html">a few pennies for charity</a>. </p>
