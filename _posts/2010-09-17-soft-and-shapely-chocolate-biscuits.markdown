<p>I can't remember on what marvelous blog I stumbled across this recipe. Despite its simplicity, it yields - in my opinion - some of the most perfect chocolate biscuits. They keep their shape beautifully during baking, yet remain soft.  Mind you, this might have something to do with using egg yolks (instead of whole eggs) as well as massive quantities of butter. And while phrases such as "dangerously chocolatey" generally making me cringe, these guys just might be, especially when sandwiched with dark chocolate ganache.</p>
<ul>
<li>220g butter, softened</li>
<li>1 cup icing sugar</li>
<li>2/3 cup cocoa</li>
<li>2 cups plain flour</li>
<li>2 egg yolks</li>
<li>Big pinch of sea salt</li>
</ul>
<p>RECIPE:</p>
<p>1.  In a large bowl, combine the butter and icing sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add the yolks, one at a time, beating until just combined after each addition.</p>
<p>2. Combine the salt and flour and sift into the butter mixture in batches, mixing just to combine after each addition.</p>
<p>3. Roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface and press into a disk. Cover in cling film and pop into fridge for at least 30 minutes before rolling out to about 1/2 cm thickness and cutting out into your favourite shapes.</p>
<p>4. Pop into a 170 degree oven for about 12 minutes, no more than fifteen. Transfer to a wire rack, cool, sandwich with your favourite filling or just pour a tall glass of milk and commence face stuffing.</p>
<p>The dough kept well in the fridge for a few days and yielded massive quantities of cookies. I used a 4 inch cutter to make sandwich cookies and filled them with raspberry jam as well as white and dark chocolate ganache. Insert Homer Simpson drool here.</p>
