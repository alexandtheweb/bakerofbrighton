<p>In the pages of an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bake-Cook-Murdoch-Books/dp/1740454677/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1247416516&amp;sr=8-1">unassuming little baking book</a> I bought on Friday I found a very good, very simple sweet shortcrust pastry recipe. I've had nothing but woes in the past with <a href="http://bakingbynumbers.blogspot.com/2008/05/pierre-hermes-pate-sucree.html">Pierre Herme's pate sucree</a> - it took ages to chill and tore to bits (at least when manhandled by my rolling pin) - but this beauty chilled quickly and rolled easily.</p>
<p>Recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>200g plain all purpose flour, sifted</li>
<li>85g icing / confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
<li>100g (3.5oz) chilled unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 egg yolk, whisked gently with 1 tablespoon of ice water</li>
</ul>
<p>Pulse flour, sugar and chilled butter in a food processor just until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk/water mixture and pulse again just until the dough starts to come together. If it doesn't, add a little bit more water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and press into a flat, round disc. Cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I used it to make some cherry galettes, which D. seemed to love, and lemon tarts, using a <a href="http://parispastry.blogspot.com/2009/07/lemon-tartlets.html">newly discovered lemon cream recipe</a> that was to die for. </p>
