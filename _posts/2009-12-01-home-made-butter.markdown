<p>I'm forever running out of butter. Which means poor Dave is forever being sent out to get more! But if I ever have a pot of left-over double (heavy) cream, it's fairly easy to make a bit of your own butter. And no, it's not necessary to shake the hell out of the cream for hours - an electric mixer can work as well. This <a id="i36_" title="butter-making guide" href="http://www.makingyourown.co.uk/make-your-own-butter.html">butter-making guide</a> is an excellent start.</p>
