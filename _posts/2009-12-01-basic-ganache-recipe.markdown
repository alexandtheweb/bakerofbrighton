<p>The most amazing cake frosting is also the easiest. There are two methods for making ganache. I prefer the second one, even if it does take a bit more effort, as it gives a glossier result. </p>
<p>RECIPE 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>255g dark chocolate (at least 53% cocoa liqueur)</li>
<li>1 cup cream</li>
</ul>
<p>RECIPE 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Method 1: </strong>Melt the chocolate in a double boiler; add the chilled cream and stir until smooth. Don't give up! The mixture will take a minute or two to come together into a smooth pourable/spreadable frosting. Use it almost straight away, as it will set pretty quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Method 2: </strong>Chop chop chop the chocolate as finely as you can - or shave it using a grater. Place in a mixing bowl. Bring the cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate then stir until smooth. You're done!</li>
</ul>
