<p>Inifinity Foods, in the heart of Brighton's North Laine, is the go-to place for local, organic, vegetarian food. Over the past two years the shop has doubled in size - although if it were up to me it could grow bigger still! I love its vast selection of organic chocolates, teas, and veggies that, unlike their eerily perfect supermarket counterparts, actually look like they were grown in the earth and plucked by human hands. Some months ago the deli section began selling ready-made sandwiches and salads, many of which come with seriously tasty dips. The baba ghanoush is gorgeous. If you're lucky the shop also has occasional tastings of its goods so you can try a bit of vegetarian sushi, salsa, chocolate, etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, the highlight of the shop is the <a href="http://www.infinityfoodsretail.co.uk/bakery/">in-house bakery</a>, arguably most famous for its massive slabs of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free pizzas, which are eagerly snatched up by hungry locals each lunch time. The idea of a vegan, gluten-free pizza may not sound too appealing - abominable even - but I've been converted. The shop's bakery doesn't do many cakes or pastries - for those, try the Infinity Foods cafe. Â However, sticky buns, scones and muffins are to be found among the leavened and unleavened breads. The leavened breads, remarkably, are made with natural starters rather than ready yeast. A Brighton treasure.</p>
