<p>I used to dismiss the call for cake flour in recipes as a bit of a pretension - it also seems impossible to find it in your everyday supermarket! However, cake flour really does make cakes lighter and more delicate. Here is the home-made version:</p>
<p>Recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup minus 3 Tbsp flour</li>
<li>3 Tbsp corn or potato flour</li>
</ul>
