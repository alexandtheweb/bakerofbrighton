Last week was extraordinary in many ways: the end of an adventurous weekend in Lisbon, a risky personal decision (more on that later) and finally, to top it all off, a fantastic bake sale to raise money for the <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/Donate-Now/Make-a-single-donation/Japan-Tsunami-Appeal">British Red Cross Japan Tsunami appeal</a>.</p>
<p>Lead by the wonderful <a href="http://annamarkwell.com/">Anna</a>, at least a dozen bakers contributed everything from flapjacks and sponges to slices and tarts. My own contributions included brownies and, naturally, a pile of macarons. The sun helped bring out the Brighton crowds and within a measly 3 hours, our heaving tables of cakes were diminished to mere crumbs. And just as we were folding up shop, thinking that no one would come to collect the last few remaining treats, a lovely chap came by and offered us £20 for the remaining lot! In a perfect world I can't imagine doing anything better for a living: meeting people, raising money for a good cause and baking. </p>
<p>More photos from the event <a href="http://photography.juliaclaxton.net/cakes4japan/slideshow">can be found here</a> and, of course, you can still make a contribution to the <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/Donate-Now/Make-a-single-donation/Japan-Tsunami-Appeal">tsunami appeal</a> - albeit without cake!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Oh my word. Just found out that the bake sale raised £1600! </p>
