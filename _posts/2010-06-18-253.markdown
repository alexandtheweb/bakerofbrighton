<p>Hi, I’m Alex, a designer by day and baker by every other spare minute. I live in beautiful Brighton, home to some great chocolate makers and patisseries.</p>
<p>My fondness for baking escalated about 2 years ago, when I realised what a fantastic creative outlet it could be. Losing myself in something tangible and non-computery was a wonderful release and I’ve since made everything from breads to delicate genoise to cupcakes and macaroons. Not to mention that I’ve found kneading dough is great for RSI :-)<br />

I love baking for parties, special occasions and charity events. If you’d like my help in creating that perfect , just use the contact form below. You can also email me or find me on twitter. Plenty of notice advised!</p>
